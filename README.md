# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

### Project Motivation & Purpose
My motivation behind improving the provided code was be able to save and review notes about how I have spent my day in a work scheduler. Additionally, by adding styling, it makes it easy for me as a user to see the current time and where I should be in my workstreams for the day. Lastly, by improving this code, I am able to see the current date at the top of the page upon opening the link.

### What I Learned Doing This Project

As a result of doing this project, I have gotten more practice on how to implement for loops to apply code across a group of code blocks. Additionally, I have learned how to use JQuery syntax to traverse the DOM and execute functions and methods as appropriate. Lastly, I have learned how to set and get information from local storage. This skill is improved from my last challenge set as I was able to successfully implement this code this time around. Where I would want to continue to push my learning in regards to the concepts related to this project is just continuing to become more comfortable with JQuery syntax. Many of my mistakes in implementing the code and meeting the acceptance criteria had to do with small errors in my syntax that threw errors in my code. I will commit to studying JQuery more to improve the speed in which I can code in JQuery in the future.
